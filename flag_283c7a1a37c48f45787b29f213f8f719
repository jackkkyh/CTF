As no one can solve this question so let me explain the intended solution:
1. Complete Meta Reader 1
2. Read `admin.php` and found out there is no way to bypass IP check
3. Target should be SSRF using XXE, it works for remote sites but does not work on 127.0.0.1:33004
4. You know the server is nginx (by header)
5. Read config file `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` (or `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default`)
6. Get the port number `8080`
7. Request 127.0.0.1:8080/admin.php and do RCE
8. You're here.
